                <summary>1. Create an Account</summary>
                <p>The first step is Creating An Account in Place for Purpose. This involves completing a brief questionnaire to help us understand who you are, what your interests and goals are, and how your values align with Baltimore Corps. Once you submit your questionnaire, your application will be reviewed based on Values Alignment with Baltimore Corps (link to values). When your application has been approved, you will receive an email to schedule a Consultation with our team.</p>

                <summary>2. Build a Profile</summary>
                <p>Your Profile captures your skills, capabilities and experiences (see Creating a Profile and Resume above) and we use it along with your Interest Statements (see below) to assess your qualifications for specific roles. Think of it as a more holistic resume to help us get a complete picture of your background and experience. We encourage you to use this as a master document to capture all of your amazing experiences so make sure to tag your capabilities, to showcase your contributions and impact in past and current roles. You can add to this Profile at any time and customize your Profile to share for specific positions.</p>

                <summary>3. Schedule a Consultation</summary>
                <p>The Consultation is our opportunity to learn more about your interests and goals, to orient you to applying for roles in Place for Purpose, to learn how we can support you with your Profile, and to answer any questions about the system or process. Your profile does not need to be finished to schedule a Consultation. However, we recommend having it started and as complete as possible so we can help with specific questions. What is the difference between applying for a role and expressing interest?</p>

                <summary>4. Apply for Opportunities</summary>
                <p>After your Consultation, you will have access to open roles in the Place for Purpose. Login to your account and click on the Opportunities tab to see what is currently available. We will also post opportunities at https://www.baltimorecorps.org/careers. Select the “Apply” button. Then, customize your Profile for the position by selecting the experiences on your Profile you want to share for this position. All other experiences on your profile will be hidden. Next, draft an Interest Statement (see below) to attach with your customized resume for each position. This should be 1-2 paragraphs stating why you would be a great fit for the role. You can hit the “Preview Resume” to see how your Profile will populate into a standard resume template - this is what the hiring manager will see before you submit. Hit Submit!</p>
